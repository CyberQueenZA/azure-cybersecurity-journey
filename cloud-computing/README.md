Cloud Computing Fundamentals
What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. It eliminates the need for physical infrastructure and allows for rapid expansion of IT footprint. Cloud services include traditional IT infrastructure and newer technologies like IoT, ML, and AI.

Shared Responsibility Model
The shared responsibility model defines the responsibilities between the cloud provider and the consumer.

Traditional Datacenter: The company manages everything, from physical security to software updates.
Cloud Computing: Responsibilities are shared.
Cloud Provider Responsibilities:
Physical datacenter security
Physical network
Physical hosts
Power
Cooling
Connectivity
Maintaining the database (if using a cloud SQL database)
Consumer Responsibilities:
Data stored in the cloud
Access security
Database patches and updates (if using a virtual machine with an SQL database installed)
Information stored in the database
Service Model Dependency: The distribution of responsibility depends on the cloud service type:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Most responsibility on the consumer.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Evenly distributed responsibility.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Most responsibility on the provider.
Consumer is always responsible for:
Information and data stored in the cloud
Devices that connect to the cloud
Accounts and identities of users, services, and devices
Service Model Determines Responsibility for:
Operating systems
Network controls
Applications
Identity and infrastructure
Cloud Models
Cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources.

Private Cloud:
Used by a single entity.
Provides greater control.
Higher cost.
Fewer benefits of public cloud.
Can be hosted on-site or off-site.
Public Cloud:
Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider.
Accessible to anyone who wants to purchase cloud services.
Hybrid Cloud:
Uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.
Allows private cloud to surge for increased demand using public cloud resources.
Provides an extra layer of security by choosing which services to deploy to public vs. private infrastructure.
Multi-Cloud:
Uses multiple public cloud providers.
Azure Arc:
Manages cloud environments, including public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud.
Azure VMware Solution:
Runs VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.
Comparison of Cloud Models:

Public Cloud:
No capital expenditures to scale up
Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
Pay only for what is used
Organizations don't have complete control over security and resources
Private Cloud:
Organizations have complete control over resources and security
Data is not collocated with other organizations' data
Organizations determine where to run applications
Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates
Hybrid Cloud:
Provides the most flexibility
Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements
Consumption-Based Model
Cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model (OpEx).

Capital Expenditure (CapEx): One-time, up-front expenditure for tangible resources.
Operational Expenditure (OpEx): Spending on services or products over time.
Benefits of consumption-based model:

No upfront costs.
No need to manage costly infrastructure.
Ability to pay for more resources when needed.
Ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
Traditional datacenter requires estimation of future resource needs. Cloud removes the need to worry about getting resource needs exactly right.

Cloud Pricing Models
Cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Pay only for the cloud services used.
Plan and manage operating costs.
Run infrastructure more efficiently.
Scale as business needs change.
Cloud resources are rented, not owned. The cloud provider maintains the underlying infrastructure. This enables organizations to solve business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to users.
