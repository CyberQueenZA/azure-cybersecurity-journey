🌩️ Cloud Computing Fundamentals – Summary What is Cloud Computing? Cloud computing delivers IT services (servers, storage, software, databases, AI, etc.) over the internet. It removes the need for physical infrastructure, supports rapid scaling, and offers flexible, cost-efficient solutions.

🔐 Shared Responsibility Model Traditional Datacenter: The company manages everything.

Cloud Computing: Responsibilities are shared.

Cloud Provider Handles:

Physical datacenter & security

Networking, hosts, power, cooling

Database maintenance (if using managed service)

Consumer Handles:

Data stored in the cloud

User/device access security

Updates/patches (for self-managed systems)

Service Models:

IaaS: Consumer manages most

PaaS: Split responsibility

SaaS: Provider manages most

Consumer is Always Responsible for:

Data & information

Connected devices

User identities/accounts

☁️ Cloud Deployment Models Private Cloud: Used by one organization. More control, higher cost.

Public Cloud: Third-party owned. Scalable, cost-effective, less control.

Hybrid Cloud: Mix of public & private. Flexible & secure.

Multi-Cloud: Uses multiple public cloud providers.

Tools:

Azure Arc: Manages hybrid/multi-cloud environments.

Azure VMware Solution: Runs VMware on Azure.

💸 Cloud Pricing & Consumption Models Consumption-Based (OpEx): Pay for what you use, when you use it.

No upfront costs

Scalable based on need

Turn off services when not needed

CapEx vs OpEx:

CapEx: One-time hardware/software costs

OpEx: Ongoing cloud service costs

📊 Cloud Pricing Model Benefits No hardware ownership

Efficient scaling

Controlled operating costs

Cloud provider maintains infrastructure
